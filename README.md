# Life-Expectancy-Analysis-and-Prediction
In our work, we aim to design a machine learning
model that helps analyze alternative scenarios to determine
whether a country is more likely to have a worse/better Life
Expectancy due to factors such as Accessibility, Economy,
Environment, Education, and Health features. The project
will look to enable the end user to then set goals on
the various parameters and thus generate potential Life
Expectancy goals.
We start with exploratory data analysis to uncover
underlying trends between the predictors and Life
Expectancy. We then used Linear Regression, ARIMA(Time-
Series) Modelling, as well as a Neural Network model
to perform predictions on our data-set to get potential
life expectancy. We had two end goals, the first, was to
understand how the various parameters acting as inputs
affect the Life Expectancy of the country in question.
The second goal was to perform an extended exploratory
analysis of our data-set to be able to visualize the change
in parameters as well as Life Expectancy across the years.



# Our dataset is contained in the worlbank_v2.xlsx

We have two seperate code sets for our modelling and exploratory analysis.
